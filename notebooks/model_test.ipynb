    "## Encodage sémantique des genres principaux et secondaires\n",
    "\n",
    "Dans ce bloc de code, on a utilisé le modèle `sentence-transformers/paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2` pour transformer les genres textuels en vecteurs numériques (embeddings) exploitables par un algorithme de machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Étapes réalisées :\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Extraction des genres secondaires uniques**\n",
    "   - On a nettoyé la colonne `Genres Secondaires` pour isoler tous les genres distincts.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Embedding des genres secondaires**\n",
    "   - On a généré un vecteur dense pour chaque genre secondaire unique à l’aide du modèle `MiniLM`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Réduction des genres secondaires par ligne**\n",
    "   - Pour chaque livre, on a calculé la moyenne des vecteurs des genres secondaires présents.\n",
    "   - Ensuite, on a sélectionné le genre le plus proche de cette moyenne par similarité cosinus. Ce genre est stocké dans une nouvelle colonne `Genre_Sec_Privege`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Embedding des genres principaux et secondaires**\n",
    "   - On a créé deux nouvelles colonnes `Embedding_Genre_Principal` et `Embedding_Genre_Secondaire` qui contiennent les vecteurs respectifs des genres textuels.\n",
    "   - Ces vecteurs seront utilisés comme variables d'entrée dans nos modèles prédictifs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intérêt :\n",
    "Cette méthode permet d’utiliser des représentations vectorielles sémantiques riches des genres (plutôt qu’un simple encodage catégoriel), ce qui peut améliorer les performances du modèle en capturant des proximités entre genres similaires."
